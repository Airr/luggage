{"name":"Luggage","body":"The Luggage is a project to create a wrapper to make Apple PKG format\r\npackages.\r\n\r\nIt does not use the PackageMaker GUI, but it does require that the developer\r\ntools be installed so it can call the command line version.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\nYou can get peer review of a package by examining the diffs between versions\r\nof your Makefile. No more wading through a zillion annoying GUI panes.\r\n\r\nFull documentation can be found at http://wiki.github.com/unixorn/luggage/\r\n\r\nExample packages can be found at https://github.com/unixorn/luggage-examples\r\n\r\nNote : This version adds a command line option to remove the application prior to installation (app2luggage.rb).","tagline":"Project to automate OS X package creation without using packagemaker GUI","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
