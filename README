The Luggage is a project to create a wrapper to make Apple PKG format
packages.

It does not use the PackageMaker GUI, but it does require that the developer
tools be installed so it can call the command line version.

Advantages:
You can get peer review of a package by examining the diffs between versions
of your Makefile. No more wading through a zillion annoying GUI panes.

Full documentation can be found at http://wiki.github.com/unixorn/luggage/

This repo is for example luggage packages. If you're repacking
something commercial, don't add the commercial part - just the
Makefile, plus a script (or preferably a stanza in the Makefile)
to download the commercial part locally before making the package.

If you're going to submit an example, please don't change the 
include statement to a non-standard luggage.make location.
